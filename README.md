# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in Python. 

## How to Play

The game asks for the number of rounds you want to play. In each round, you will be asked to choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will also make a choice. The winner of the round is determined based on the rules of the game:

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beat paper
- Paper beats rock

If both you and the computer make the same choice, the round is a tie.

The game keeps track of the number of rounds you win, the number of rounds the computer wins, and the number of ties. At the end of the game, the overall winner is announced.

## Running the Tests

The `tests.py` file just contains a matrix and two conditionals that show the even numbers and the odd numbers respectively. some tests for the game. You may use this file to add your own tests and ty them. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python tests.py
```
